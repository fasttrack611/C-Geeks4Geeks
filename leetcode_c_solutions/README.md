# LeetCode C Solutions

This repository contains C solutions to various LeetCode problems. The solutions are organized into subdirectories based on the problem category.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run a specific solution, you can use a C compiler like GCC. For example, to compile the `two_sum.c` solution, you would run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gcc array/two_sum.c -o two_sum
```

This will create an executable file named `two_sum`. You can then run the executable to test the solution. Note that you will need to write your own `main` function to test the solutions, as the provided files only contain the solution functions themselves.
