# LeetCode C Solutions

This repository contains C solutions to various LeetCode problems. The solutions are organized into subdirectories based on the problem category.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the array solutions, you can use a C compiler like GCC. Navigate to the `leetcode_c_solutions/array` directory and run the following command:

```bash
gcc main.c -o array_solutions
```

This will create an executable file named `array_solutions`. You can then run the executable to test the array solutions.
